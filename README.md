## License and Use of FullCalendar

This project uses FullCalendar Premium. Depending on your use case, you may need to obtain a specific type of license:

- **Commercial Use**: For-profit companies and individuals must purchase a commercial license. This license allows source code modifications but does not permit redistribution of modifications.
- **Non-Commercial Use**: Registered non-profit organizations can use FullCalendar Premium with a free, non-commercial license. This license does not permit source code modifications.
- **GPLv3 Open-Source Projects**: Fully GPLv3-compliant open-source projects can use FullCalendar Premium freely under the GPLv3 license.

For more, and up-to-date information, visit the [FullCalendar License](https://fullcalendar.io/license) page.

### Setting the License Key in Django

To set the FullCalendar Premium license key in Django, add the following line to your Django settings file:

```python
FULL_CALENDAR_LICENSE_KEY = 'your_license_key_here'
```

Replace `'your_license_key_here'` with your actual FullCalendar Premium license key.
